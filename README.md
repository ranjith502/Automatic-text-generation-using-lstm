# Automatic-text-generation-using-lstm

we are going to generate text using two methods
1) word by word sequence
2) letter by letter sequence
# word by word sequence
1) converting lines to paragraph
2) cleaning of text 
3) creating data text we are using 50 words to predict next word
4) preparing data into lstm format
5) training model 
7) predicting next word

# letter by letter sequence
1) cleaning of text 
3) creating data text we are using 100 characters to predict next character
4) preparing data into lstm format
5) training model 
7) predicting next word
